# TODO

[] Debug points issue

[] Add small animation for fist 10 points

[] Add animation for every 50 points achieved
    [] Will have to have conditional that if prevPoints were > 50, then no animation (lost points)

[] Animation for losing points? Something small and cute?

[] Some sort of animation on the points-box each time points increase? / decease?
